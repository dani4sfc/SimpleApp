SimpleApp
Spring boot at the backend, angular at the front, and in order to make it lighter, I use in this case H2 databases, which are charged on memory.

The app is basically a note app "In progress". I will be improving the app the following days.

This is the backEnd repository, The frontEnd repository will be allocated on a different repository (SimpleApp-Front).
